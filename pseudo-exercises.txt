// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(x + y)


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

take a number
if number remainder =0/2
number is even
otherwise number is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) n1,n2,n3,n4,n5
b) add numbers/5
c) if n1<n2
   set max at n2
   if n2<n3
   set max at n3
   if n3<n4
   set max at n4
   if n4<n5
   set max at n5
write out "the max is"
write max number

if n1>n2
set min to n2
if n2>n3
set min to n3
if n3>n4
set min to n4
if n4>n5
set min to n5
write out "the min is"
write min number
